## 1. ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL

**1.1. Purpose:** The community and school were established to teach everyone about Bitcoin development, recognizing that Bitcoin development is a collaborative, open-source process accessible to developers at all stages.

**1.2. Educational Materials:** We use a curriculum that converges the teachings of the world's leading Bitcoin development schools, including but not limited to Base58, Chaincode Labs, Bitshala, and the University of Nicosia. Our courses are also based on the latest editions of the O'Reilly books 'Mastering Bitcoin' and 'Mastering the Lightning Network'.

**1.3. Classes, Courses, Lectures, Learning Opportunities:** We host our community interactions on a Discord server. Classes are conducted via Google Meet or in person at Fatec—Ribeirão Preto. The Discord server is open for everyone to learn, but classes on Google Meet or in person are organized in advance and participate in private Discord channels. Additionally, synchronous classes are recorded for the benefit of other students.

**1.4. Bitdevs:** We organize Bitdevs Ribeirão Preto, which takes place on the last Thursday of each month in the evening at Fatec. The code of conduct also applies to the event. Details of the meetings are announced in the Meetup community: [Meetup Tecnologia Bitcoin](https://www.meetup.com/tecnologia-bitcoin-pesquisa-e-desenvolvimento/)

## 2. OUR CONDUCT GUIDELINES

**2.1. Scope:** Abusive or undesirable behaviors still deeply impact individuals and the community when they occur outside our physical or online spaces. If someone's behavior outside the Scalar School Community and School makes you feel unsafe within the Scalar School Community and School, this is absolutely relevant and subject to action on our part.

**2.2. General Guidelines:**
We live in a diverse world, yet mutual respect for differences is non-negotiable for us. In the open Bitcoin development environment, the biggest problem we experience is misogyny—hatred and disrespect against women. Therefore, we continuously strive to develop a safe and respectful space for anyone in the community and school, with special attention to feminist issues in the ecosystem.

**2.3. Specific Guidelines:**

(i) **Gender Equity:** All genders are welcome. We aim for gender equity close to 50/50 between men and women, as we believe this has the potential to create better software and fairer societies.

(ii) **Prohibition of Misogynistic Content:** The use of content that sexually objectifies any individual or demeans them intellectually is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, references to Bitcoin Red Pill, 'cortes 38tão', and any materials or statements that demean women, their intellectual capacity, or their right to fully participate in the open developer community.

(iii) **Gender Equality and Biological Typification:** Any materials or communications that perpetuate gender stereotypes or biological typifications are prohibited. For example, claims like "Women tend to XYZ" or "Men like KWY" are not accepted. This includes but is not limited to statements that undermine the value or capabilities of any gender.

(iv) **Microaggressions and Subtle Misogynies:** Microaggressions, such as comments that underestimate women's intellectual capacity, are prohibited. An example is saying "There were women at Bitdevs, they managed to participate even in the most difficult technical subjects," which implies intellectual inferiority based on gender.

(v) **Respectful Discussion of Social Movements:** Discussions that question the fundamental merits of social movements, including feminism, are prohibited. Our community recognizes the importance of feminism and other social movements for achieving equality and respect for all genders in technology spaces. We welcome creative solutions for fostering inclusion and respect within our community.

(vi) **Religious or Ideological Pretexts:** Our community respects all religions and cultures but does not tolerate their use as a pretext for practicing misogyny or restricting anyone’s freedom of choice. This includes, but is not limited to, justifications based on religious beliefs, moral values, political ideologies, or any other ideologies that seek to limit the rights and freedoms of others.

**2.4. Harassment:**
Harassment, whether online or in the real world, causes physical and psychological harm to people. Here is a non-exhaustive list of instances of harassment that will not be tolerated in the school's virtual or physical environments.

(i) **Social Ostracism:** Coordinated action to ignore and isolate individuals will not be tolerated in the school's environments. Social ostracism also includes interfering with someone's ability to contribute with excessive criticism or isolation.

(ii) **Dogpiling:** Dogpiling is a form of harassment where a group of people attacks an individual online to intimidate or humiliate them. If we discover any community and school members participating in communities where dogpiling is practiced, inside or outside the community and school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate and without the need for justification on our part.

(iii) **Organized Hate Groups:** Current or historical groups organized to promote ideologies including, but not limited to, anti-LGBTQ, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitism, fascism, male supremacy, white nationalism, or white supremacy. We are aware of the existence of these groups nationally and internationally and aim to create a community free from their influence. If we discover any community and school members participating in communities where hate or contempt against other groups of people is practiced, inside or outside the community and school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate and without the need for justification on our part.

(iv) **Gangstalking:** Gangstalking is a comprehensive term that describes a series of techniques used by a group to instill mental instability in the victim, with the goal of discrediting, sabotaging, harassing, extorting, and even leading the victim to suicide. A gangstalking victim can have their reputation, credibility, career, relationships, and entire life ruined. Techniques such as mind games, perception manipulation, organized stalking, covert harassment, constant surveillance, and possibly electronic harassment are used to drive the victim to mental instability. Proving that someone is being targeted by gangstalking can be very challenging, and there is very little support from law enforcement, making gangstalking extremely effective. If we discover any community and school members participating in communities where gangstalking is practiced, inside or outside the community and school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate and without the need for justification on our part.

(v) **Bullying:** Behaviors, language, or creative works that intimidate individuals are prohibited. Acts that qualify as bullying include, but are not limited to, threatening violence to intimidate, mocking based on sexual history or status as a survivor of sexual assault, sharing degrading photos or videos, and derogatory edited images. Memes that sexually objectify women or depict them in humiliating positions will not be tolerated.

(vi) **Stalking:** Continuing individual communication after one party has requested it to cease. Stalking and harassment online or offline will not be tolerated in the school's environments.

(vii) **Retaliation:** Retaliation for reporting or threatening to report harassment will not be tolerated.

(viii) **Hate Speech:** Offensive language directed at individuals or groups of people based on caste, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, age, immigration status, national origin, race, religion, serious medical condition, sex, or sexual orientation. Attacks may include (but are not limited to) dehumanizing language, harmful slurs or stereotypes, and calls for violence, exclusion, or segregation.

(ix) **Sexual Harassment:** Unwanted sexual attention. Inappropriate visual displays, memes, photographs, cartoons, drawings, or gestures that are sexually oriented or offensive, or that sexually objectify any individual. Inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual or romantic attention.

(x) **Threats and Incitement to Violence:** Threats and incitements to violence or physical harm are treated with the utmost seriousness. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to, organizing or disclosing aspirational, conditional, or credible plans for a violent act; soliciting advice for, advocating for, or threatening the safety of public or private individuals.

(xi) **Doxxing:** Doxxing is a form of harassment where someone shares personally identifiable information about an individual (e.g., home address, phone number, bank account information, medical information) online without consent. This abusive act can lead to online and offline harm against the individual, such as stalking, emotional distress, physical harm, job loss, and identity theft. Exceptions to this policy may include someone publishing their own personally identifiable information, publishing someone else's personally identifiable information with the individual's consent, and sensitive information from documents properly in the public domain (e.g., court filings, press releases, news articles).

**2.4.1. Other Prohibitions:**

(i) **Terrorists or terrorist organizations:** Non-state actors that commit, advocate for, or support acts of violence against civilians for political, religious, or ideological aims. Scalar School strictly prohibits terrorism and violent extremism in community spaces. If we discover any community and school members participating in terrorist organizations, inside or outside the school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate.

(ii) **Criminal organizations:** Groups or associates engaged in criminal activity or enterprises, including but not limited to violent crimes (e.g., torture, homicide), kidnapping, trafficking (e.g., humans, drugs, firearms), or financial crimes (e.g., money laundering, extortion, scams, fraud). If we discover any community and school members participating in criminal organizations, inside or outside the school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate.

(iii) **Actively involved in armed conflicts:** Armed militias or other groups that are actively involved in conflicts, military training, or acquisition of military equipment; individuals perpetrating mass violence. If we discover any community and school members participating in organizations that perpetuate mass violence, inside or outside the school environments, the suspension from the school's environments is immediate.

**2.4.2. General Conduct Norms:**

(i) **Respect and Courtesy:** Mutual respect and courtesy must prevail, valuing diverse backgrounds, cultures, opinions, races, colors, creeds, religions, sexual orientations, and genders.

(ii) **Responsibility and Honesty:** Students, partners, and teachers must take responsibility for their actions and remain honest in all interactions.

(iii) **Safety:** Physical and emotional safety is a priority. Any form of misogyny, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, or behavior that harms others' development is not tolerated. There is a large organized hate group against women in Bitcoin development and the technology industry in general, and we aim to create a safe haven from this group's actions.

(iv) **Active Participation:** All students are encouraged to actively engage in school activities, respecting established norms and regulations.

(v) **Anti-Threats:** Threatening someone physically or verbally, for example, threatening to publish sensitive information about someone's personal life, will not be tolerated.

(vi) **Substance Use:** The use of illegal substances, such as drugs and alcohol, is strictly prohibited during any class, course, meeting, or lecture.

(vii) **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Everyone must respect the privacy and personal data of others, sharing information only with explicit permission.

**2.5. Incident Management Process:** Anyone can report conduct that violates our rules. Incidents should be reported by sending a private message to Luciana via Discord or email to luciana@scalarschool.org. Details of the incident, including what happened, when, and who was involved, will be confidentially recorded.

**2.6. Disciplinary Actions:** Depending on the findings, measures such as warnings or expulsion may be applied as described in this Code of Conduct. We encourage the reporting of any behavior that violates this code of conduct. Reports will be handled confidentially and professionally.
