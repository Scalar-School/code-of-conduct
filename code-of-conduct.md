# Code of Conduct

It is impossible to be intellectually and socially productive if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against. Accordingly, all local community members are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether in person, in our online community, or in other contexts.
To ensure that everyone understands “showing respect and courtesy to each other,” we have adopted the following code of conduct.
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, neurodivergence, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other characteristics.
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind and courteous to others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Collaborating with other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable behavior

The following types of behavior are unacceptable and constitute code of conduct violations.

## Abusive behavior

**Harassment**—including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.

**Threats**—threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

Private or public harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Since harassment can take many forms, here's a non-exhaustive list of what we consider unacceptable behavior:

- Offensive language directed at individuals or groups of people
- Bullying (verbal, physical, social, or cyber)
- Interfering with someone's ability to contribute, like with excessive nitpicking
- Continued one-on-one communication after a party has requested it cease
- Stalking online or offline
- Doxing or unauthorized publication of private information or communication
- Unwelcomed sexual attention
- Inappropriate visual displays such as sexually-oriented or offensive photography, cartoons, drawings, or gestures
- Retaliation for reporting or threatening to report harassment

## Unwelcoming behavior

**Blatantisms**—saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Or that we don’t have enough women in Bitcoin because they are bad at Maths or inherently not interested in STEM fields. Hence, we can do nothing to nurture their presence in our field.

**Subtle-isms** and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior.

**Maliciousness towards other community members**—deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that they don’t belong. If you notice any ‘you don’t belong’ vibes, something IS wrong and should be addressed early on. 

**Being especially unpleasant**—for example, if we’ve received reports from multiple community members or faculty of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior.

## Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes, or imagery in interactions, communications, or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. 

Additionally, touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos, is unacceptable. This includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is unacceptable. The sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text is unacceptable.

## On victim blaming

> *“Don't judge. Be a soft place for a friend, sibling, neighbor, co-worker to land. Open your heart and mind to someone who might be in pain. Stop blaming the victims; we must be more outraged by all forms of abuse. No one has the right to hurt another person. Verbal abuse can be as damaging as physical abuse. As a society, we must be more outraged and hold these perpetrators accountable. Stop making victims feel as if THEY did something wrong. If you see something, say something. Speak up. YOU could be saving someone's life.”*

—RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network)

Victim blaming is a reality in our society and comes in many flavors. We will be working always to try to understand the victim’s actions and reactions in front of a situation of abuse. For example, suppose the person tries to defend herself and ends up causing harm to the abuser (verbally or otherwise). In that case, we’ll try to understand if the reflex was a natural and welcome reaction on the victim’s side. We want victims to feel empowered to end abuse and protect their mental health. Being able to defend oneself can help heal the side effects of the abusive situation. 

Some examples are: 
—A person who was raped is held guilty because they provoked the rapist, because they were using short skirts, or because they decided to drink or take drugs. 
—Holding victims responsible for the harassment or discrimination they face, questioning why they didn't speak up sooner or why they were in a particular place or situation at work.
—Blaming students for poor academic performance without considering external factors like learning disabilities, home environment, bullying, or quality of teaching.
—Attributing someone's illness, like cancer or diabetes, to their lifestyle choices (like diet, exercise), ignoring genetic, environmental, and other risk factors beyond individual control.
—Suggesting that victims of cyberbullying or online shaming brought it upon themselves by sharing too much information online or engaging in specific online communities.

## Scope
Abusive or unwelcoming behavior still profoundly impacts individuals and the community when it happens beyond our walls or online spaces. If someone’s behavior outside of Bitdevs Community makes you feel unsafe at Bitdevs Community, that is absolutely relevant and actionable for us.

## Enforcement and Reporting

If you feel that a community member has engaged in inappropriate behavior, please do not hesitate to contact the group admins. **However, the most important thing is the common understanding of the code of conduct so that as community members we can maintain high standards of professionalism and respect.**

**Why should I report? Why should I speak up if I see something?**
You are responsible for making the Bitdevs Community a safe and comfortable space for everyone. Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. We hope that this does not become an environment with reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism"). The idea is to maintain common sense, professionalism, and absolute respect for all people.

## Acting Unilaterally
If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to someone's safety (for example, threats of violence), any of the admins can act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation.

In ongoing situations, any member may, at their discretion, employ any of the available tools, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any admin may—and should—act unilaterally to protect safety.

When an individual member acts unilaterally, they must report their actions to the other admins.

## Social rules
In addition to having a code of conduct, we have four lightweight social rules. The social rules are different and separate from the code of conduct. They help us create a better learning environment by giving names to counterproductive behavior and acting as a release valve so that frustration doesn't build up over time. We expect people to break the social rules from time to time unintentionally. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person or community member. When this happens, it's not a big deal. **Just apologize and move on.**

The Bitdevs Community has four social rules. They help create a friendly, intellectual environment where you can spend as much energy as possible on learning and programming.

The social rules are:

- No well-actually’s
- No feigned surprise
- No backseat driving
- No subtle -isms

The social rules name subtle behaviors that put others down or show how much we know instead of supporting each other’s learning. They work with the self-directives to make Bitdevs Community an even better place to learn and grow.

Working at the edge of your abilities requires taking emotional risks, and the social rules help create an environment where it’s safe to do that. Letting someone know that they impacted you by breaking a social rule and accepting that feedback gracefully when you’re the one who messed up are important ways to learn generously. This allows everyone to keep working and growing together.

One thing that often surprises people about the social rules is that we expect people to break them occasionally. This means they’re different from our code of conduct, which covers behaviors that are never acceptable, like abuse, discrimination, and harassment.

**No well-actually’s**
Alice: I just installed Linux on my computer!
Bob: It’s actually called GNU/Linux.

A well-actually is when you correct someone about something irrelevant to the conversation or tangential to what they’re trying to say. They’re bad because they aren’t helpful, break the flow of conversation, and focus attention on the person making the well actually.

This rule can be tricky because there isn’t a clear line between relevant to the conversation and not. Sometimes, your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it. The best rule of thumb is if you’re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens. You can always say it later if there’s no way for the conversation to move forward without your correction.

**No feigning surprise**
Dan: What’s the command line?
Carol: Wait, you’ve never used the command line?

Feigned surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the future, which makes it harder for them to learn.

No feigning surprise isn’t a great name. When someone acts surprised when you don’t know something, it doesn’t matter whether they’re pretending to be surprised or actually surprised. The effect is the same: the next time you have a question, you’re more likely to keep your mouth shut. 

**No backseat driving**
Bob: What’s the name of the string copy function?
Alice: Strncpy.
Eve: (from across the room) You should use strlcpy. It’s safer.

Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room (or across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice that’s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, busting into a conversation without asking is rude. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.

**No subtle -isms**
Carol: Windows is hard to use.
Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.

Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things we sometimes do by mistake. Subtle -isms make people feel like they don’t belong at Bitdevs Community. We want to create an environment where everyone can focus all their energy on learning and coding. It’s hard to do that if you’re regularly being made to wonder whether you belong.

Subtle -isms can also be things that you do instead of say. This includes things like boxing out the only woman on the whiteboard during a discussion or assuming someone isn’t a programmer because of their race or gender.

The fourth social rule is more complicated than the others. Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize. And not everyone experiences subtle -isms in the same way: subtle homophobia won’t hurt someone who’s straight in the same way it hurts someone who’s gay.

**There’s another part of no subtle -isms: If you see racism, sexism, misogyny etc. outside of Bitdevs Community, please don’t bring it in.**

For example, please don’t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Tech Person Y. Everyone who comes to Bitdevs Community should have the same opportunity to focus on learning and programming, and people from oppressed groups often find discussions of racism, sexism, etc. particularly hard to tune out. There are many places to discuss and debate these issues, but there are few where people can avoid them. Bitdevs Community is one of those places.

**How do they work?**
The social rules are lightweight. You should not be afraid of breaking a social rule. These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, "Hey, you just feigned surprise," or "That’s subtly sexist," or “That is misogynistic!” don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on. We are all learning to break the cycle of abuse we are raised under.

The social rules aren’t for punishing people. They help make Bitdevs Community a pleasant environment where you can be yourself, tackle things outside your comfort zone, and focus on learning.

## When to seek help immediately

Contact the police authorities directly (call 190) to report criminal activities (e.g. physical assault, sexual assault, theft) or to report a dangerous physical situation (e.g. fire, serious injury, fear that someone will hurt themselves or someone else).

## Final remarks
> *“I have been in a lot of online communities over the last 20 years. I have never seen a community fall apart due to excessive banning of trolls, but almost all of them have fallen apart due to excessive trolling. I’d strongly encourage any online community to adopt a similar policy.”*
